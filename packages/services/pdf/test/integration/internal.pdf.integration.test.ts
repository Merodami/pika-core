/**
 * PDF Service - Internal API Integration Tests
 *
 * This file is currently empty as the PDF service does not expose any internal endpoints.
 * Internal endpoints would be service-to-service communication routes that bypass
 * standard authentication and are used for inter-service operations.
 *
 * If internal routes are added in the future (e.g., /internal/voucher-books/generate),
 * this file should be updated to include appropriate integration tests.
